/**
 * Shared error predicates for the threads module.
 *
 * The RPC client preserves `error.code`/`error.data`, but app-server overloads
 * its JSON-RPC codes: -32600 is the catch-all for rejected requests, and -32601
 * covers both a genuinely missing method and a thread with no persisted history
 * yet. A code alone therefore cannot tell "this turn is in progress" from "this
 * field is unknown" from "this thread is empty". Codes and the calling method
 * gate the predicates; message matching is what discriminates, and keeping it
 * here makes an upstream wording change a one-file fix.
 *
 * Patterns are kept narrow and mutually exclusive on purpose — an over-broad
 * one silently reclassifies errors depending on which predicate runs first.
